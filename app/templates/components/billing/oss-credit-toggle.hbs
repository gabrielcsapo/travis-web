    You can use paid credits both for build jobs run over public and private repositories. 
    You can use ‘OSS only’ credits only for build jobs run over public repositories. 
    If the ‘OSS credits consumption’ is set to OFF, paid credits will not be used for build
    jobs run over public repositories. ‘OSS only credits’ are available and renewed as per terms of selected plan.
